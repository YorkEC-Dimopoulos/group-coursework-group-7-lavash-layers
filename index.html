      <h2 id="highlights">Quick highlights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Best first walk:</strong> Republic Square → Northern Avenue → Opera area, then finish at the Cascade for views.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunset plan:</strong> grab a takeaway coffee, climb the Cascade terraces, and stay for the city lights.</li>
        <li><strong>Quick local bite:</strong> try a fresh pastry from a bakery, then follow it with a casual shawarma stop.</li>
        <li><strong>Culture in 2 hours:</strong> one museum/gallery in the centre, then a slow evening stroll through the nearby parks.</li>
        <li><strong>Budget hangout:</strong> pick a central park bench, people-watch, and spend your money on dessert instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Weekend vibe:</strong> browse Vernissage Market for crafts and souvenirs, then walk back into the centre for lunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Want “real city” energy?</strong> choose one neighbourhood and explore side streets, courtyards, and small cafés.</li>
        <li><strong>Short on time:</strong> stay in the centre—most key sights are close enough to do on foot in one afternoon.</li>
