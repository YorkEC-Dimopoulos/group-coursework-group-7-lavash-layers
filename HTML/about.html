      <h3 class="member__role">Group Leader (Home + About Us)</h3>
      <p class="member__bio">Hi, I'm Gabriel Payan, the group leader for The Pink Route. I built the Home page and the About Us page, focusing on a clear structure and easy navigation. On the Home page, I introduced Yerevan, added the category links, and wrote quick highlights so visitors can plan a simple route fast. On the About Us page, I presented the team and the project goal, making sure the site feels organised and consistent across all pages.</span>

      <p class="member__bio">Hi, I’m Elen Serobyan, a developer on The Pink Route. I created the Food &amp; Cafés page, where I collected student-friendly recommendations and local favourites to help visitors eat well in Yerevan without spending too much. My goal was to keep it practical: what to try, where to go for a quick meal, and which cafés are good for relaxing or studying. I focused on clear descriptions so users can choose a spot easily.</span>

      <h3 class="member__role">Developer (Entertainment)</h3>
      <p class="member__bio">Hi, I’m Alex Berezovski, and I worked on the Entertainment &amp; Culture page. I designed it to help visitors find the best things to do in Yerevan, especially in the city centre. I included key landmarks and cultural spots, and organised the content into sections with “On this page” links so it’s easy to jump between topics. My goal was to make the page useful for both quick visits and longer stays by giving clear, walkable ideas.</p>

      <p class="member__bio">Hi, I’m Samuel Darbinyan, a developer for The Pink Route. I built the City Life &amp; Neighbourhoods page, focusing on the everyday side of Yerevan—where to walk, relax, meet friends, and experience local atmosphere. I aimed to describe the vibe of different areas and suggest simple plans for day-to-night activities. My main goal was to help new students and visitors feel comfortable exploring beyond the main tourist spots.</p>

      <p class="member__bio">Hi, I’m Stefan Atanasovski, and I created the History &amp; Heritage page. I focused on the story behind Yerevan—how the city developed over time and which places help you understand its past. My aim was to make history easy to follow by choosing key sites and writing short, clear explanations. I organised the content so visitors can learn quickly and connect historical landmarks to the modern city they see today.</p>
